My name is Kai Zheng, and I'm a phisics PhD student working on particle experiment at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am working for the ATLAS collaboration of [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at Switzerland, CERN. My research focus on analysing data for new physics, applying machine learning/deep learning in particle experiment and developing software using c++.

I have solid background in physics and mathematics. I have also fulfilled the course requirements for a master degree in Statistics. I have taken various CS courses including data structure, computer vision, parallel programming, computer graphics, etc.

I am very interested in computer graphics. I have taken various courses on Rendering, Interactive graphics, Computational geometry, Physics-based animation, Game development, etc.

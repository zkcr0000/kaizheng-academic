M﻿y name is Kai Zheng, and I'm a phisicst PhD student working on particle experiment at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am working for the ATLAS collaboration of [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at Switzerland, CERN. My research focus on analysing data for new physics, applying machine learning/deep learning in particle experiment and developing software using c++.

I﻿ have solid background in physics and mathematics. I have also fulfilled the course requirements for a master degree in Statistics. I have taken various CS courses including data structure, computer vision, parallel programming, computer graphics, etc.

I﻿ am very interested in computer graphics. I have taken various courses on Rendering, Interactive graphics, Computational geometry, Physics-based animation, Game development, etc.

Planning to graduate in May 2024, now I am looking for an internship in 2023 on computer graphics or related area: Game developer, Physics simulation, Computer graphics researcher/developer, Deep learning researcher related to graphics including 3D reconstruction, Neural Rendering, Digital copy, etc.
